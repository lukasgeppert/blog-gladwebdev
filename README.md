Blog-gladwebdev is a NextJS 13 blog inspired by what I learned from the previous blog tutorial by Sonny Sangha. It is made using the latest version of Next13 including the expiremental appDir feature.

## What are the features of blog-gladwebdev

Determined to create a blog using NextJS with the ability to display a code block, I searched for more inspiration on how to implement markdown-to-jsx. I researched different approaches and watched multiple tutorials on the topic. Eventually, I came across the idea of creating a static website with a static markdown file, which proved to be the easiest way to achieve my goal. By using a static file, I was able to avoid some of the type errors that can arise when working with dynamic content, and I gained a better understanding of how TypeScript interfaces work.

## What went well

Developing this application was an excellent opportunity for me to gain valuable experience coding with NextJS and TypeScript. Throughout the development process, I had to constantly check for type errors that arises which strengthens my understanding of typescript. Overall, I was happy with the progress I made and as a result, I successfully launched my blogging platform, which now hosts various tech-related articles and tutorials.

## Future improvements

I would like to implement several additional features in this project, including the ability to filter blog posts based on user search parameters and syntax highlighting for code blocks.
